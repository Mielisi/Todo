# Todo
A simple todo app made with react

Some functions: 
Possibility to use a back-end like google fire base or some other that use http calls to upload data modify and more.

# Features
You can: 
-Add a task
-Mark a task as completed
-Filter tast from all, completed or not completed
-Remove task

For now is a very simple application and i'm using this to practice react, for now the only language is Italian but after i'll finish optimize and adding some new core feature (such as being able to add the date the task was added), i'll start to work to an english version, sorry if the code isn't commented

# Usage instruction:

First of all you'll need to install node.js or yarn (For now i'll write the instruction only for nodeJS because i don't use yarn)
