# Todo
A simple todo app made with react

# Features
You can: <br>
- Add a task 
- Mark a task as completed 
- Filter tast from all, completed or not completed
- Remove task
- Upload all Task to a back-end

For now is a very simple application and i'm using this to practice react, for now the only language is Italian but after i'll finish optimize and adding some new core feature (such as being able to add the date the task was added), i'll start to work to an english version.

# Usage instruction

# Prerequisites

<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" > node.js </a> (i'll raccomend to use 18@LTS version ) or  <br> <a href ="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install"> yarn </a> (For now i'll write the instruction only for nodeJS because i don't use yarn)

# Developer Build

If you want to start the developer build is pretty simple: <br>

- First you'll need to clone the repository (you can use whaterever you want git or download the zip)
- Go to the repository folder and run: <h4> npm install </h4>
- After npm finishes to install all dependencies you'll need to run: <h4> npm start</h4>

# Production ready build

To make a production ready build is very simple too: <br>
- First you'll need to clone the repository (you can use whaterever you want git or download the zip)
- Go to the repository folder and run: <h4> npm install </h4>
- After npm finishes to install all dependencies you'll need to run <h4> npm install -g serve </h4> (If you are on MacOS or Linux you'll need to run npm as root, for windows you'll need to run CMD or PowerShell as administrator)
- After this you'll need to run <h4> serve build </h4> and now you have the production build running
